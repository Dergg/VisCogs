# VisCogs
 My final year university project, aiming to create an interactive data visualisation program to show relationships between record labels in the Discogs database.

## What is the research question?

{G}iven a database filled with crowdsourced free-text information, is there an alorithm that exists to extract information to detail the history of a given label?

## How am I tackling this?

Using either NLTK or spaCy (currently still experimenting with both), I aim to use natural language processing algorithms to extract different categories of events and an associated timestamp so they can be visually shown as a temporal network graph, detailing various record labels and relationships between them.
